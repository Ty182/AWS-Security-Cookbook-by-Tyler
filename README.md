# AWS Security Cookbook by Tyler 📖 ☁️
Welcome to my AWS Security Cookbook - a collection of AWS security service overviews and related code designed to help you understand, deploy, and experiment with various AWS security services. This repository provides Terraform code to simplify provisioning and enablement, allowing you to quickly spin up AWS environments for learning, testing, or building real-world use cases.

## What's Inside?
📚 Service Overviews
  - High-level explanations of AWS services and their use cases

🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  - Ready-to-use Terraform code to automate deployments
  - I've chosen not to use advanced Terraform features like modules to ensure the code is simple and accessible to a wide audience. As such, you'll want to consider optimizing it for your needs
