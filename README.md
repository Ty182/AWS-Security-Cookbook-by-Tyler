# üìñ ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Security Cookbook by Tyler
Welcome to my AWS Security Cookbook - a collection of recipes (guides) to help you learn, build, and deploy security controls in AWS! 

## How to Use

## How to Get Started
If you want to learn AWS security, head to [AWS Security Cookbook](https://www.techwithtyler.dev/academy/aws-security-cookbook) and choose any lab to start!
Otherwise, you can use this code repository as a useful example for deploying and managing AWS security services.

## How much will this cost?
- This content is completely free! However, some recipes may spin up AWS resources that incur costs.
- Being mindful of cloud costs is an important skill, and I‚Äôll provide guidance where possible‚Äîbut ultimately, you‚Äôre responsible for any charges.
- Don't let cost concerns hold you back! AWS has great documentation and transparent pricing, and many services offer free-tier options. Learning by doing is the best way to build confidence in AWS.
